<h1>It's time.</h1>

<p><strong>We have been working away to improve the way teams collaborate and deliver products into the world.</strong></p>

<p>You showed interest in helping us take the next step and we believe it's a good time to get your feedback. We are
    releasing Diff as a beta experience for a select few people and that means you.</p>

<p>As with any beta, we expect some things to be weird but don't be shy, let us know. <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/FMkZ0fL8TMFzXWpx2">Complete
        the survey</a> and put your address in the last question and you can expect some swag in the mail.</p>
